  \brief The QKeySequenceWidget is a widget to input a QKeySequence.

  This widget lets the user choose a QKeySequence, which is usually used as a
  shortcut key. The recording is initiated by calling captureKeySequence() or
  the user clicking into the widget.

  \code
    // create new QKeySequenceWidget with empty sequence
    QKeySequenceWidget *keyWidget = new QKeySequenceWidget;

    // Set sequence as "Ctrl+Alt+Space"
    keyWidget->setJeySequence(QKeySequence("Ctrl+Alt+Space"));

    // set clear button position is left
    setClearButtonShow(QKeySequenceWidget::ShowLeft);

    // set cutom clear button icon
    setClearButtonIcon(QIcon("/path/to/icon.png"));

    // connecting keySequenceChanged signal to slot
    connect(keyWidget, SIGNAL(keySequenceChanged(QKeySequence)), this, SLOT(slotKeySequenceChanged(QKeySequence)));
